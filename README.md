# Engineering Computations

This project is a collection of learning modules in engineering computations for undergraduate students. 
The project lead is [Prof. Lorena A. Barba](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/lorena-barba) at the George Washington University, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department. 
In Fall 2017, Prof. Barba worked with doctoral student Natalia C. Clementi to produce the first three modules of the series.
With student Tingyu Wang, we wrote the fourth module in 2019. 
We began writing Module 5 in 2020 and Module 6 in 2021. These are work-in-progress

Eeach learning modules is made up of several lessons, written as a Jupyter notebook, and addressing an area of application or skills in computing.
We use Python as the programming language.

## How to clone this repository

This repository uses git submodules to include contents from individual repositories for each course module. 
To clone the complete collection, use the command:

` git clone --recursive https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp.git`

## Design philosophy
We take inspiration in the ideas of [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) about computational thinking.
In particular, we want to design learning modules that adhere to Papert's _Power Principle_:

> What comes first, "using" or "understanding"? The natural mode of learning is to first use, leading slowly to understanding. New ideas are a source of power to _do something_.

## Learning Modules
